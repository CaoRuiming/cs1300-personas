    <p>What is the point of the digital alarm clock?</p>
    <p>Virtually all phones have all the features of the alarm clock built-in while also having a smaller form factor
      and more intuitive software UI.</p>
    <p>To answer this question, I chose to create personas and a storyboard for the humble digital alarm clock. Rather
      than choosing a specific product to observe people using, I focused on the overall interface of a typical
      &quot;dumb&quot; alarm clock.</p>
    <p>Below is an example of an digital clock interface that I will be considering.</p>
    <img alt="sketch of a simple digital alarm clock" src="assets/Clock.jpeg">
    <p>In my mind, these clocks serve three main purposes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>telling time through some kind of always-on display</li>
      <li>setting and ringing alarms for specific times</li>
      <li>tuning in and listening to radios</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The third point turned out to be a flawed assumption in my observations, but I will detail that later.</p>
    <h2 id="research-and-interviews">Research and Interviews</h2>
    <p>To get a better grasp on real world users of these archaic devices, I chose to remotely interview three of my
      family members. This was definitely not the most unbiased or diverse sample, but my options were limited in
      quarantine.</p>
    <p>This proved to be somewhat of a challenge because there was no single model of clock that all three interviewees
      had access to, so my observations and data were not as consistent as I would have liked.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, the three clocks that my three interviewees used shared enough features to yield useful
      information.</p>
    <p>Throughout this section, I will refer to my subjects as <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and
      <strong>C</strong>. As a quick overview of their backgrounds, <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> are
      married and working adults. <strong>C</strong> is a 1st year college student (undergraduate).</p>
    <p>This was my process during each interview:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ask general questions about aspects of the clock interface</li>
      <li>Ask the interviewed person to perform a specific task and take notes while observing their actions</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Before we go into a deeper dive into my data, here are some of my <strong>key observations</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>my assumption that most modern digital alarm clocks had radio functionality built in was false (only 1 out of
        my 3 interviewees had a clock with radio functionality)</li>
      <li>general conventions for setting time and alarms on these clocks are generally similar, but are not identical
      </li>
      <li>users usually don&#39;t set the time or alarms on their clocks often, so they often go through some (though
        not much) trial and error during these processes to remember the correct procedures</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="interview-question-results">Interview Question Results</h3>
    <p>Below are the questions I asked and brief summaries of the responses I received.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>How often do you set the time on your clock?<ul>
          <li><strong>A</strong>: once every 3 months; time gets faster over time by about 5 min per quarter</li>
          <li><strong>B</strong>: 2-5 times per year because of power outages and daylight savings adjustments</li>
          <li><strong>C</strong>: used to do it often when power outages or move clock; now not so much because of
            backup battery</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>How often do you check the time on your clock?<ul>
          <li><strong>A</strong>: once or twice on weekdays (right after waking up or before going to sleep); several
            more times on weekends because of naps</li>
          <li><strong>B</strong>: at least 3 times a day - before going to sleep, after waking up in the morning, and
            during midnight bathroom breaks</li>
          <li><strong>C</strong>: &gt;50 times a day if they are in their room</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>How often do you use the alarm functionality of your clock?<ul>
          <li><strong>A</strong>: daily (in the morning), 7:10am</li>
          <li><strong>B</strong>: never; always awoken by <strong>A</strong>&#39;s alarm</li>
          <li><strong>C</strong>: never; usually use phone for alarm because they have a bunk bed and the clock is on a
            desk one level below</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>How often do you use the radio functionality of the clock? Why?<ul>
          <li><strong>A</strong>: never; too many buttons to press; radio app on phone has clearer audio</li>
          <li><strong>B</strong>: never - does not listen to news on radio</li>
          <li><strong>C</strong>: never - does not listen to radio</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Why would you use an digital clock instead of using your phone?<ul>
          <li><strong>A</strong>: would only use it if it&#39;s already easily within view</li>
          <li><strong>B</strong>: would use it at night to avoid using wifi-connecting electronic devices near the bed
            and because of health concerns over radation from smart devices</li>
          <li><strong>C</strong>: more convenient when sitting at desk because it has an always on display, unlike phone
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>What is your most common use for the clock?<ul>
          <li><strong>A</strong>: tell time; alarms</li>
          <li><strong>B</strong>: tell time, especially when they only need to know the time and want to avoid
            distractions</li>
          <li><strong>C</strong>: tell time</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>What is your favorite part of using the clock?<ul>
          <li><strong>A</strong>: sentimental value; clock was bought by loved one and still functions well enough</li>
          <li><strong>B</strong>: night light - can use light from clock display to find orientation/location in the
            dark; the clock has worked well for around two decades</li>
          <li><strong>C</strong>: it does its job (telling the time)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>What is the most frustrating part of using your clock?<ul>
          <li><strong>A</strong>: have to manually set the time once per quarter</li>
          <li><strong>B</strong>: no backup battery to keep time in the case of a power outage</li>
          <li><strong>C</strong>: if there are no batteries installed, they have to set time manually more often when
            adjusting clock positions; need to readjust position of clock every now and then for projection
            functionality</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Describe your daily interactions with your clock.<ul>
          <li><strong>A</strong>: check the time before go to bed, get awoken in the morning by music</li>
          <li><strong>B</strong>: check before go to bed, use light to navigate to bathroom and back, check time in the
            morning</li>
          <li><strong>C</strong>: look at often through day and night to check the time</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>What is an improvement that you would most want to see in this clock?<ul>
          <li><strong>A</strong>: none because of low expectations; just needs to tell time correctly</li>
          <li><strong>B</strong>: add support for backup batteries so that power outages don&#39;t reset the time</li>
          <li><strong>C</strong>: remember time without using batteries; add more weight so it doesn&#39;t shift on desk
            over time</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="observations">Observations</h3>
    <p>For this part of my interview process, I asked my subjects to perform the following tasks:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Manually set the time on the clock to the current time</li>
      <li>Set an alarm for 8:10am</li>
      <li>Turn on the radio on the clock</li>
      <li>Tune into a radio station</li>
      <li>Turn the radio off</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Below are summaries of notable parts of my observations for each of the interviewees.</p>
    <h4 id="subject-a">Subject A</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>had to set the time twice because they did not set am/pm correctly the first time</li>
      <li>expressed frustration while setting the time and alarm because they could only increment (and not decrement)
        hour and minute values</li>
      <li>tried to enable the radio in the clock for 30 seconds before remembering that they had to press the radio
        power button first</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="subject-b">Subject B</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>could not read the small font of the button labels and had to wear reading glasses to proceed</li>
      <li>noted that they could only increment (and not decrement) hours and minutes while setting time and alarms</li>
      <li>had to set the time twice because they did not set am/pm correctly the first time</li>
      <li>set the alarm but did not remember how to turn it on until finding the power switch for the alarm (which was
        placed away from the other buttons on the clock)</li>
      <li>clock had no radio functionality</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="subject-c">Subject C</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>process for setting time was done without notable hiccups</li>
      <li>had to attempt setting the alarm multiple times because the alarm-setting mode automatically deactivated if no
        button was pressed within a second after pressing the alarm-setting button</li>
      <li>clock had no radio functionality</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="personas">Personas</h2>
    <p>From my <em>diverse</em> set of interviews, I can group my data to form 2 personas who find value in digital
      alarm clocks: one that represents working adults who have provided for their families, and one that represents a
      younger generation who are current or possibly recently graduated students.</p>
    <h3 id="persona-1-driven-dave">Persona 1: Driven Dave</h3>
    <p>Driven Dave is a married father who travels fairly frequently as part of his job. He adheres to a strict,
      health-minded schedule, and he often likes to cut out the noise from smart-devices when he wants to focus on work
      or sleep.</p>
    <h4>Empathy Map</h4>
    <ul class="empathy-map">
      <li>Thinks<ul>
          <li>I will go to bed in 30 minutes</li>
          <li>If I press this button, then this functionality of the clock will be toggled</li>
          <li>I&#39;m getting too many notifications right now</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Feels<ul>
          <li>Slightly overwhelmed by fancy internet-connected technology everywhere</li>
          <li>Frustrated when clock&#39;s time drifts off the true time over a few months</li>
          <li>Fond of old digital clock that has worked for years</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Says<ul>
          <li>It&#39;s 9:30. Time to go to bed!</li>
          <li>I remember now, you have to long press this power button to turn on the alarm</li>
          <li>This font so small and hard to read</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Does<ul>
          <li>Maintains a consistent schedule</li>
          <li>Reminds family members to improve their sleep schedules</li>
          <li>Wakes up early and awakens family members if necessary</li>
          <li>Keeps pressing buttons and making deductions on his clock until he gets what he wants</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The main clock interface problems that Driven Dave faces are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>small and/or low contrast labels for buttons</li>
      <li>lack of clear indication of whether the time is am or pm</li>
      <li>the need to relearn the infrequently used process of setting time or alarms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Driven Dave represents many users who are parents of older students as he has settled into a comfortable schedule
      that he has found over time, and he values quiet, &quot;disconnected&quot; time like others in his demographic who
      are concerned about the digital takeover of the lives of the younger generation.</p>
    <h3 id="persona-2-student-sammy">Persona 2: Student Sammy</h3>
    <p>Student Sammy is a new college student who is in the process of finding and maintaining her own schedule away
      from home. She has grown up to be relatively tech-savvy, and she values convenience and utility in her choices
      while under COVID-19 quarantine.</p>
    <h4>Empathy Map</h4>
    <ul class="empathy-map">
      <li>Thinks<ul>
          <li>I have to shower at 10pm before the hot water runs out</li>
          <li>The meeting for my new club is in an hour, and there&#39;s another meeting after that</li>
          <li>I&#39;m too lazy to reach over and pick up my phone...</li>
          <li>It&#39;s so convenient that my clock projects the time on the ceiling</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Feels<ul>
          <li>Somewhat anxious about all of the new events scheduled in calendar</li>
          <li>Unsure about exact plans next week</li>
          <li>Fear of missing out on &quot;college life&quot;</li>
          <li>Annoyed at having to press multiple buttons many times to set alarms</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Says<ul>
          <li>Why can&#39;t this clock have more than 2 alarms set?</li>
          <li>I can&#39;t take a call then; I have a remote movie viewing for 2 hours</li>
          <li>Scheduling things is a pain</li>
          <li>Ugh. Now my clock is 20 seconds late</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Does<ul>
          <li>Strictly follows calendar schedule</li>

          <li>Glances at the clock every few minutes to keep track of time</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The main clock interface problems that Student Sammy faces are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>lack of options when setting alarms (especially multiple at once)</li>
      <li>the friction involved setting time or alarm through the clocks buttons compared to using a smartphone</li>
      <li>lack of bells and whistles (though this is sometimes a good thing)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Student Sammy represents a subset of new college freshman (or just college students in general) who are in the
      process of discovering and taking responsibility for themselves outside of the direct reach of their
      parents/family. Like many 1st years, Sammy is eager to explore her options in school, even if it&#39;s through
      conferencing software due to quarantine. Additionally, Sammy, like many students who have grown up using
      smartphones, is used to the flexibility and convenience offered by modern computing devices.</p>
    <h2 id="storyboards">Storyboards</h2>
    <p>Now let's put one of these Personas to use! To outline a realistic scenario that would be encountered by Driven Dave, I created a simple storyboard below. Typically, these should convey more emotion, but I can't draw, and there can only be so much drama involved with setting up a digital alarm clock (right?).</p>
    <ol class="storyboard">
      <li>
        <img alt="flashing clock with unset time" src="assets/Board1.jpeg">
        At 9pm, Dave is <strong>tired</strong> and is ready to go to bed, but he is <strong>annoyed</strong> to find that a recent power outage has
        reset his clock&#39;s time and alarm.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img alt="" src="assets/Board2.jpeg">
        Dave starts the process of setting things right by pressing the set button (S) on the clock to enter time
        setting mode.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img alt="" src="assets/Board3.jpeg">
        Dave presses the hour and minute buttons until the correct hour (along with am/pm) and minute appears; then he
        presses the set button (S) to exit time setting mode.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img alt="" src="assets/Board4.jpeg">
        To make sure that he <strong>gets up on time</strong> the next morning, Dave presses the alarm (A) button on the clock to enter
        alarm setting mode.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img alt="" src="assets/Board5.jpeg">
        Dave presses the hour and minute buttons until the correct hour (along with am/pm) and minute appears; then he
        presses the alarm button (A) to exit alarm setting mode.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img alt="" src="assets/Board6.jpeg">
        Dave toggles the alarm power switch <strong>several times</strong> until he sees an alarm indicator on the display to make <strong>extra sure</strong> that his alarm will sound in the morning.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img alt="" src="assets/Board7.jpeg">
        <strong>Dave finally goes to bed.</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <img alt="" src="assets/Board8.jpeg">
        The alarm set on the clock <strong>wakes</strong> Dave up at 7:10am, and he shuts it off before getting out of bed.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>So, what did I learn after all this?</p>
    <p>From my limited observations and personas, I think that digital alarm clocks are here to stay as time-telling
      devices. All 3 of my interviewees appreicated the simplicity and durability of their clocks; however, it seems
      that the more &quot;advanced&quot; features (e.g. alarms and radio) of modern digital alarm clocks are largely
      unused because smartphones execute them better.</p>
